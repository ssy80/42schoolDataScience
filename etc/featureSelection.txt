1. PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

PCA transforms your features into new, uncorrelated components.

Each principal component captures the maximum variance.

You lose some interpretability (because PCs are linear combinations, not original features).

üëâ Good when:

You have many correlated features (e.g. Empowered, Stims, Recovery all move together).

You want to reduce dimensions (e.g. 30 features ‚Üí 5 PCs).

Your main goal is prediction, not interpretability.

2. Feature Selection

Instead of transforming features, we choose the most important ones.

a) Correlation-based (what we did earlier)

Keep features with correlation > threshold.

Simple, but ignores feature interactions.

b) Model-based (Embedded methods)

Use a model that gives feature importance:


Which to use?

If you want interpretability (knowing which stats matter most for Jedi vs Sith):
‚Üí Use feature selection (Random Forest, Lasso, or correlation filtering).

If you want dimensionality reduction & efficiency (many features, collinearity):
‚Üí Use PCA (but you lose original feature meaning).



Perfect üöÄ That‚Äôs a really strong approach:

Select the most important features (filter out the weak/noisy ones).

Apply PCA on the reduced feature set to remove collinearity & compress into fewer dimensions.



What this does:

Uses RandomForest to rank features by importance.

Keeps the top 15 features (you can adjust N).

Standardizes them (important for PCA).

Runs PCA, keeping 95% of variance.

Prints how much dimensionality was reduced.


Yes üëç ‚Äî for regression you can also use RandomForestRegressor to do feature filtering.

The logic is the same:

For classification ‚Üí RandomForestClassifier gives feature importance based on how well each feature splits the classes.

For regression ‚Üí RandomForestRegressor gives feature importance based on how much each feature reduces variance (MSE) across splits.


‚úÖ So yes ‚Äî RandomForest works for both classification and regression as a feature selection filter before PCA (or even directly as input to models).

    ‚úÖ With splitting: You get realistic performance estimates and avoid overfitting

    ‚úÖ Result: A model that genuinely works well on new, unseen data

    The validation set lets you answer:

    "What's the best number of neighbors for KNN to classify Jedi vs Sith?"

    "Should I use Random Forest or SVM for this problem?"

    "What parameters give the best generalization to new knights?"

    Compare predictions with y_val to get true performance

    ]


Important:

Use stratify=df['knight'] only for classification problems (because ‚Äúknight‚Äù is categorical).

For regression, you should not use stratify.

Regression is used when your target (label) is a continuous numeric value ‚Äî something that can take on any number within a range.

Summary: Regression vs Classification
Type	Target Variable	Example Problem	Example Algorithms
Regression	Continuous (real numbers)	Predicting a house price ($450,000)	Linear Regression, RandomForestRegressor, XGBoostRegressor
Classification	Categorical (discrete classes)	Predicting whether a person is a Jedi or Sith	Logistic Regression, RandomForestClassifier, SVM, Neural Network



A confusion matrix is a table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model ‚Äî 
it shows how well your model‚Äôs predictions match the true labels.

The correlation heatmap will help you identify which features are strongly related (values close to 1 or -1) 
and which features might help distinguish between Jedi and Sith characteristics!


StandardScaler puts all your features on a level playing field so that PCA can find the true underlying patterns in your Jedi/Sth data, rather than just detecting which features have the largest numerical values!

PCA (Principal Component Analysis) is a dimensionality reduction technique that transforms your data into a new coordinate system
 where the greatest variances lie along the first axis (principal component),
 the second greatest along the second axis, and so on.

üéØ Simple Analogy

Think of your 30 features as 30 different measurements of Jedi/Sith abilities:

    Original space: 30-dimensional space (each feature is one dimension)

    PCA finds: New "summary dimensions" that capture the main patterns

    PC1 (44.21%): The single most important "summary dimension"

    PC2 (18.31%): The second most important "summary dimension"

The principal components are new composite features that summarize your original 30 features in a more efficient way!


Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is a statistical measure that quantifies how much the variance of a regression coefficient 
is inflated due to multicollinearity in the model.

Simple Explanation

Think of VIF as a "redundancy detector" for your features:

    Low VIF (1-5): The feature provides unique information

    High VIF (>5-10): The feature is largely redundant with other features

    Very High VIF (>10): The feature is almost completely explained by other features

    "VIF measures multicollinearity among PREDICTOR variables",

How the Root Node's Gini Value Drives Splits

The core mechanism of a Decision Tree is to find the split that maximizes the reduction in impurity. 
This reduction can be thought of as "Gini Gain"

Calculate Root Impurity: First, the algorithm calculates the Gini Impurity of the root node using 
the distribution of the target classes in your full dataset

Test Potential Splits: For each possible feature and potential split point, the algorithm 
calculates the weighted average Gini Impurity of the two child nodes that would result from that split

Select the Best Split: The algorithm compares the impurity of the root node with the weighted impurity of the potential child nodes. 
The feature and split point that result in the largest drop in impurity (the greatest Gini Gain) is chosen for the root node's split
